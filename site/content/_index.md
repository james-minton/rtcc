<h1>The Right to Counsel Toolkit</h1>

Welcome to the RTCNYC Coalition's Campaign Toolkit!! After a three-year campaign, in August 2017, we won a landmark victory making NYC the first City in the nation to establish a right to counsel for low-income tenants facing eviction. San Francisco soon became the second city to make eviction defense a right. We are inspired by other tenant organizing groups across the country who see RTC as a tool to build tenant power in their cities and are working on campaigns in their cities.  To support these efforts, with the help of the Community Development Project, we created this toolkit, which is designed to both tell the story of how we won RTC in NYC and offer templates for organizers in other cities to adapt, modify and improve on the victory. We hope it's of service to the tenant movement.
