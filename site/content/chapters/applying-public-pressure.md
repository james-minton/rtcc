We tried to be strategic about when to apply public pressure. Before launching the very public aspects of our campaign, we used the tools that precede this section: we built our case through fact sheets and forums, we conducted outreach and recruited allies, produced a cost/benefit analysis, created videos and other materials, collected signatures and endorsements, and much more, all to help build a large base of support. We waited until we had a lot in place, until we were “getting to yes” and building momentum before we held the hearing on the legislation and other public pressure tactics. This section of the toolkit provides you with tools that worked well for us, and examples for use in the more public stages of your campaign. 

Included are:

* Hearings: Examples from our campaign’s hearings, including agendas, a flyer and a tool to help you prepare for giving testimony at a hearing.
* Press Conferences: Includes example agendas.
