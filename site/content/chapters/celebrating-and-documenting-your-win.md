Celebration and commemoration are important parts of your campaign.  When your coalition wins, it is momentous! Even if you know your organizing will be ongoing, it is important to mark your victories. Take the time to have a party, celebrate your coalition and tenant leaders, and thank your allies. It is also important to document your win, both for your internal purposes and to ensure that the story of your campaign is told through your own words. Often after major organizing wins, the public narrative focuses just on what was won (that a Right to Counsel was passed) and not on how it was won or who fought for it. It is important for your campaign, and for the broader tenant movement, for your organizing story to be told.  Ask yourself some questions about what you want to document. What worked well that got you to this point?  What is the story you want to tell about the campaign? How does your campaign fit into a larger narrative of tenant activism? Take the time after your win to develop materials that you can use to tell your story and continue to engage others. 

Once we won the campaign, we had a huge party where we mostly danced! There isn’t a tool for that but we did get the space, food, DJ and other costs donated by coalition members. We had a very short program led by two tenant leaders (no other speakers) who acknowledged all of the coalition members and then we ate and danced! 

In this section we share examples of our work that celebrated and documented our win. Included are:

* Facilitator Guide for Teach-ins on Right to Counsel History: Celebrating a Tenant Movement Victory: A guide to meetings that tell the history of our campaign and ensure the story of Right to Counsel is told from the perspective of the tenant movement.
* Creating an Interactive Timeline of Your Right to Counsel Win: A component of our teach-ins, this interactive timeline allows community members to participate in telling the history of Right to Counsel.
* Teach In Facilitation Guide for Tenants on how Right to Counsel works: A guide and agenda for facilitating a workshop on how Right To Counsel works.
* What We Have Won Through Activism: Documenting Tenant Movement Wins: A visual representation of key moments in the history of tenant activism, situating Right to Counsel as part of a larger movement. 
* Documenting Lessons Learned From Your Campaign: A document memorializing key organizing lessons from the campaign.

## Activity on Right to Counsel History: Facilitator Guide

As part of celebrating and memorializing the passage of the Right to Counsel bill, our coalition developed a facilitation guide and an exercise to be used to teach people about Right to Counsel’s history.

This activity was part of a larger meeting. It can be used at a workshop, tenant association meeting, an outreach training, a community meeting, an orientation for new lawyers, etc. You can make the meeting last 20 minutes or 40 minutes, depending on which activities you choose to facilitate. The goal of having an activity about our history was to be able to incorporate our history into many different forums, ensuring that the story of Right to Counsel would be told from the perspective of the tenant movement, with emphasis on organizing efforts and opportunities.  It was also a way to really celebrate and acknowledge our victory as we prepare for the work ahead!

## Interactive Timeline of Right to Counsel Win

In documenting and celebrating your win, an interactive timeline of your coalition’s progress can be used in celebrations, presentations, member education nights and more. A timeline documents the pivotal moments in your campaign-- when you first introduced the legislation, held town halls, garnered press and more.  

This timeline was made for use in our <a href="/docs/11/RTC History Activity Facilitation Guide.pdf" target="_blank">interactive presentation of RTC history</a>. The pages of the timeline are numbered and distributed to participants, and each person who receives a page of the timeline comes forward to read it. In this way, the community takes part in assembling our history and celebrating our victory.

We have included our timeline here, which you can adapt to celebrate your own win!
