## Sample PowerPoint Presentation about the Right to Counsel

This short presentation is designed to introduce potential stakeholders to the issues that underlay the need for a right to counsel, the importance and potential impact of the legislation itself and our coalition. The presentation ends with an ask to the Mayor to sign a petition. The presentation is designed to be brief and targeted for settings where time is limited, and it can be adapted to a variety of audiences.
