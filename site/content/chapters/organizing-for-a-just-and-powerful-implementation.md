Once we won, we began a whole new campaign to ensure a just implementation of the law and also to ensure that the law helps build tenant power through bold organizing. We developed a lot of materials and structures to support implementation and increase awareness. This was in part because city government was not creating these mechanisms fast enough to keep up with the need for them, and because developing these resources allowed us to continue to control the narrative around Right to Counsel. Organizing around implementation had 4 main components: tenant outreach, education and organizing; advocacy related to court based procedures and policies; training tenant attorneys (new and old); and working to improve, strengthen and expand the legislation. In this phase of the campaign we began to fundraise for dedicated resources to support the coalition, and we hired a coalition coordinator as we recognized that the implementation work would require additional resources. As we moved forward, we dedicated resources primarily to support neighborhood-based community organizing work, but also for resources like our Eviction Free NYC website.

In NYC, the law funds lawyers, not organizers, which is something we are working to change.  We have important questions to answer: now that tenants have this new right, how do they learn about it? And once they are informed about it, how do they claim it as theirs and use it to unleash organizing potential and build the tenant movement? While there is a lot of work to do around implementation, the majority of our resources go to supporting this type of work. 

Please note that we developed the toolkit while still running a just implementation campaign. So this list of tools is not exhaustive! It’s just a sample. Definitely feel free to reach out to us if you have questions about organizing around just implementation! 

Included are three sets of tools:

<h3>Coalition Tools around Principles and Messaging</h3>

* **Guiding Principles for Right to Counsel Legislation and Implementation:** Developed by our coalition to advocate for the best possible language in the legislation as well as the best possible implementation. 
* **Tips for Speaking to the Press about Implementation:** Developed to ensure a consistent and strategic message.
* **Working Groups for Implementation and Ongoing Organizing:** Describes the work of our different working groups as we continue the implementation process.

<h3>Tools for Outreach/Tenant Engagement and Education</h3>

* **Frequently Asked Questions:** Designed as a community education tool to ensure tenants know their rights as well as to explain how the five year phase in would work, given that during this time some tenants have access to RTC while others do not.
* **Facilitation Guide and Q&A for Right to Counsel and Implementation:** Designed to get the word out about implementation for tenants, legal service providers, legislators and other stakeholders.
* **New Website:** Eviction Free NYC: Our website gives people access to information about Right to Counsel, helps determines their eligibility and shares how to connect to an attorney.  

<h3>Tools for Ongoing Organizing</h3>

* **Right to Counsel 2.0:** The Work to Come: Documenting our vision for continued organizing to strengthen Right to Counsel in New York City.
* **Working Groups for Implementation and Ongoing Organizing:** To organize the work of your campaign’s implementation organizing phase.
* **Town Hall Guiding Agenda:** To organize and facilitate public meetings in which implementation is outlined.
* **Supporting Implementation Organizing:** These tools are designed to guide ongoing organizing:
  * Principles
  * Organizing Timeline
  * Town Hall phone banking 
  * Overview of organizing with RTC
