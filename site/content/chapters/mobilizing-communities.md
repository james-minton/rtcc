Town hall meetings are crucial events that can engage, educate and mobilize communities around issues. During our campaign, neighborhood-based community organizing groups came together to plan shared agendas, outreach plans, as well as guiding principles like ensuring that the town halls provided food, interpretation services and childcare. So while the neighborhood-based community groups ran town halls in their communities, there was always overarching support and guidance from the coalition.  

The tools here are intended to support planning and facilitating public events. Included are: 

* **Checklists for Organizing Tenant Town Halls Forum:** Includes outreach and logistical tips to plan effective and engaging public meetings.
* **Town Hall Facilitation Guide:** This guide assists with facilitating the programming of town halls, and includes a brief history of the RTCNYC Coalition and goals for the meeting. We’ve also included a link in the document to the facilitator’s guide for the small breakout group that we used, which you may find useful in planning your own small groups.
* **Interfaith Forum Agenda and Letter from Faith Leaders for the Right to Counsel:** The agenda illustrates how we planned and organized an interfaith forum, and the letter concretized the support of NYC faith communities. Both documents can be tailored to include information and demographics about your city, and do not necessarily need to be from faith leaders, but from any supporting body. 
* **Skits for Town Halls:** A guided script that helps the audience visualize the experience of housing court that should be customized based on your coalition members’ experiences. 
* **Town Hall Video:** Highlights the impact of not having legal representation while also demonstrating the level of community engagement we garnered.
* **Town Hall Report:** A handy 2-page report that highlights the reach of our organizing and can serve as a template.
* **Commitment Cards:** This template for commitment cards helps to identify community members that want to take action in the campaign.
