In our experience, convening and running a coalition dedicated to advancing the right to counsel was central to our organizing strategy. Our coalition is made up of organizations that provide direct advocacy and/or organizing around issues of housing displacement in New York City and that are dedicated to building tenant power. A broad-based coalition with a clear structure, decision making processes and goals helped us leverage community power and various resources in order to advance the campaign.

The tools offered here are intended to support your thinking about the development of your own coalition. 

Included are:

* **How We Structured the Right to Counsel New York City Coalition**: Demonstrates how we are structured and how we function.
* **Leveraging the Power of Your Institutional Members**: Suggests allies or potential allies that your coalition might leverage to provide key resources and skills you may not otherwise have access to. 

## How We Structured the Right to Counsel New York City Coalition

This document, How We Structured the Right to Counsel New York City Coalition, is intended to provide insight into our central principles, structure and decision-making processes. Our structure during the campaign was not static, and this document offers a look at how the coalition was structured during the campaign. We’d like to emphasize that it is important to be flexible and adapt to the changes that may come your way during your campaign. We also want to share the fact that our funds were very limited from the onset, and that this structure was created and staffed by employees of other organizations!

While your coalition will be tailored to your local context, we hope that our work can be a helpful model from which to build.

## RTCNYC Tool 3.2: How to Leverage the Power of Institutional Members

_During our campaign, we worked within and outside of our coalition to access different resources and skills that grassroots organizations (or unfunded coalitions like ours at the time!)  would normally find difficult to access. For example, a legal services organization in our coalition had access to working hours with a public relations consulting firm, which we were able to use to push news stories about the coalition’s work. Below is a list of key resources and skills to consider leveraging - think about who amongst your allies or potential allies might be able to connect you to such resources._

**Communications Help**

* **Public Relations Firms:** You may be working alongside organizations or other entities that retain the services of a public relations firm. Usually, organizations contract with such firms to do a certain number of hours of PR work. If possible, see if there are a few free hours a month that organizations in your coalition might be able to use to push your media coverage and draft press releases. 
* **Voices for Civil Justice:**  An organization that exists to raise the profile of civil legal aid in the media. They worked with us to develop a press release and utilized their contacts at many of the major news outlets.
* **AARP:** We worked with AARP to put together [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1raLveigHkHU-4q9uiC59OTtYiL4QZSk-/view) about Right to Counsel. It is helpful to think about the populations who will be most affected by a right to counsel (ie. retired people and the elderly) and start reaching out to organizations or lobbying groups representing those interests.

**Legal Research Help **

* **Pro Bono Counsel:**  We worked with law firms in New York to put together legal research in response to legal issues raised by the City.
* **Bar Associations:** We worked with the New York City Bar Association to commission a study on the financial costs and savings that a right to counsel would bring.
