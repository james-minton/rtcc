Many organizers undoubtedly have their own tools and preferences for campaign development exercises and campaign planning tools. Here we include several tools that we used to develop our assessment of power in our local landscape and to make informed campaign plans and decisions based on this analysis. Although our coalition’s target was clear, different organizing contexts have different needs. Conducting a power analysis to understand who has the power to make your wins possible is crucial. There are great tools for power analysis online, as well as in Chapter 8 of Joan Minieri and Paul Getsos’ _Tools for Radical Democracy_, titled “Researching the Politics of an Issue.”  We hope that the following tools will help develop your campaign strategy.

**Campaign Plan Template:** Designed to help identify and document campaign demands, targets, allies and opposition.

**“A Month in the Life of the RTCNYC Campaign”—Developing an Action Plan:**  Designed to help you map your actions out weekly, to ensure you are hitting your targets and engaging key stakeholders and decision makers. This tool includes an example plan from the coalition as well as a blank template for your use. 

**Outreach to Agencies and Institutions:** Designed to guide outreach to city agencies to garner support for and quell resistance to Right to Counsel, including understanding the agency’s mission, the rationale for reaching out to them, key contacts, and notes.

## Tool 4.1: Campaign Plan

_Campaign plans are important for identifying what you want to accomplish from the campaign, who is going to give you what you want, and how you are going to influence these people to do what you want. This tool outlines key campaign components and examples from our campaign from early 2015. There are some key terms you will want to know, so we have also provided definitions to those terms, as well as an example of how we identified our campaign needs and key people in our work. We also took time to identify who would be opposing us, and what their messaging would be. Finally, you’ll want to think about what actions will get the decision makers to move in your direction. We have other tools in the toolkit that help you plan actions such as town halls, hearings and postcard deliveries, but this tool will help you see where your actions fit in with your larger goals. Your plan will look different depending on whether you need to pass your bill at a local or state level, and who your key players are. Remember that this is a snapshot of the life of a campaign; you should regularly engage in reviewing and updating the components of this plan as things shift in time, from the secondary goals to potential allies. It is also good practice to date the plan each time updates are made._

<tr>
<td>Principal Demands</td>
<td>Changes in policy, resources or structures we want a person in power to make that are associated with actions during the campaign.</td>
<td>**General Message:** 

The Right to Counsel Coalition of NYC is made up of tenant organizing groups, tenants advocate groups, law schools and legal services organizations. We are working together to achieve justice in our city’s housing courts so that the housing courts are a place of fairness, justice and equity.  We do not support forced displacement that can and should be prevented and we believe that safe and affordable housing is central to our city’s future. We are working on establishing a right in the city of New York for New Yorkers to be represented in housing court by licensed, qualified and experienced providers, when they go to housing court to defend their rights.  

**Main Demands:** 

Our short-term goal is to pass INTRO 214 (at 200% of poverty level, including NYCHA proceedings and under HRA). 

Our mid-term goal is to change the nature of housing court so that its primary use as a tool of displacement is dismantled. 

Our long-term goal is to make housing a right and shift the balance. of power between tenants and landlords in this city.

<td>Primary Target</td>

<td>A person with power who can make a decision to give us what we want. A target is ALWAYS a person, not a group or an institution.</td>

<td>Our target is Mayor De Blasio: He used the right to counsel in his campaign platform, and the legislation fits well into his plan to create more affordable housing. </td>

<td>Secondary Demands</td>

<td>These are more “winnable” demands. These help to assess and build power to win our primary demands.</td>

<li>Hold a city council hearing.</li> 

<li>Get Bronx leaders to tour Bronx housing court, and other leaders in other boroughs too.</li>

<li>Get the Comptroller to take a position on the fiscal smartness of this.</li></ul>

<td>Secondary Targets</td>

Allies

Organizations that have a shared self-interest in the issue that you are working on. The outcome of the campaign will most likely impact them, and so they have a motivation to be involved.

We have a great alliance of community groups, academic institutions and legal services providers in our coalition.  

See the list of our allies here. 

Potential Allies 

Individuals and organizations that are not currently active in the campaign but share an interest.

We are reaching out to other organizations who are also in the movement but are not currently in the coalition or have committed to supporting the RTC legislation. 

Opposition

People who actively oppose our demands and try to stop our

campaign from moving

forward.





We identified potential opposition groups: 

Small landlords

Landlord lobbying/interest groups 

City government officials concerned about increasing costs for landlords and cost/benefits of the program.



We also anticipated what the opposition’s message might be: 

The city is already too tenant friendly. 

For landlords to do business, rents will go up because the cost of being a landlord will go up. 

Landlords will be forced to discriminate against tenants they profile as not being able to pay the rent. 

The City will be subsidizing the cost of tenants not paying rent.   

The cost of the program would be too high.

Public misperception that RTC already exists, such as in criminal court, harder to mobilize communities.  



Overall Strategy of the Campaign 

A planned series of activities

that are inter-related, exercise

power and build off one-another

with the goal of moving an

individual (target) to deliver on

a specific demand.





Some Examples Include: 

Outreach to Tenants/Members:  

Outreach in housing court on the line to have more folks who have been evicted to be a part of the work. 

Community forums in boroughs to get feedback on the legal services  model and build momentum. 



Outreach to Secondary Targets: 

Tour housing courts with key people. 

Get state electeds to be on board and talk about the savings for the state. 



Outreach to Primary Target: 

Postcard campaign to the mayor. 



Platforms for Tenants to Tell their Stories:

Create tenant profiles to illustrate the justice denied to pro se tenants

 

Addressing Opponents: 

Figure out who major players are in Housing Court. 

Who are the landlords who bring the most evictions? 

Local actions targeting landlords, harassment and displacement because of not having RTC. 



Garner Media Appearances:

Develop and place media like op-eds, to keep the issue in the news and in popular opinion. 



Current State/Stage of the Campaign 

Where you are currently in your campaign! 

  

We now have a website and database for folks to sign up and send emails through. 

We had a hugely successful forum - over 400 people came.  

Great coverage from the New York Times and Newsweek 

Working to develop a legal services model that will be presented to community members through a series of borough based town halls. 

Working on getting key electeds to tour the courts and building up to a big action at the end of March.
