One catalyst in launching our fight for the Right to Counsel stemmed from documenting the degree of intimidation, harassment and confusion in Housing Court, the power inequities between landlords and tenants and the impact this had on tenants, families and communities. We found that grassroots campaigns in the Bronx and Brooklyn shared similar demands of housing court that ultimately led to the formation of the RTCNYC Coalition. The reports on those earlier organizing efforts highlight the work that came before the coalition formed, and we’re excited to share those here with you.  

In 2012, before the formation of the coalition, New Settlement Apartments’ Community Action for Safe Apartments (“CASA”), which would later become the anchor organization for the coalition, decided to start a campaign to reform Bronx housing court. CASA partnered with the Community Development Project (“CDP”) to conduct a participatory research project. Organizers and tenants were trained and supported by CDP to lead the research. The report that resulted, [_Tipping the Scales: A Report of Tenant Experiences in Bronx Housing Court_](https://cdp.urbanjustice.org/sites/default/files/CDP.WEB.doc_Report_CASA-TippingScales-full_201303.pdf) demonstrated how difficult and confusing NYC’s housing courts were to navigate, and the vast injustice between landlords, nearly all of whom had legal representation, and tenants, nearly all of whom did not. The report documented the impacts of this power imbalance, and demonstrated just how disadvantaged unrepresented (pro se) tenants were in going up against landlords and their lawyers.

A 2011 report by Make the Road New York, who was a member of Brooklyn Tenants United, a coalition fighting for reforms to the Brooklyn Housing Court, called [_Home Court Advantage: How Landlords Are Winning and Tenants Are Losing in Brooklyn Housing Court_](https://maketheroadny.org/pix_reports/Home_Court_Advantage_12.13.11.pdf), similarly demonstrated the injustice in Brooklyn’s housing court system and the disproportionate impact on tenants who were fighting to keep their homes.

These reports, which drew attention and press to the issues faced by tenants in housing court, helped to activate others. The Right to Counsel Coalition formed a year after the release of _Tipping the Scales_, and took up the fight to address the inequities between tenants and landlords in court. We offer the reports here as examples of ways to identify and document issues. At the end of _Tipping the Scales_, you can view the survey that was used for the project, and adapt it for use in your own research.

Identifying the issues around housing court was the first step. CASA used “The Problem Tree” activity and had their members come together to identify the root causes of injustice in housing court, and problems and solutions in order to inform how to move forward. This tool is adapted from Tools for Radical Democracy: How to Organize for Power in Your Community by Joan Minieri and Paul Gestos and is used with permission.

## RTC NYC Tool 2.1: The Problem Tree

(used by permission from Joan Minieri) 

_One of the first things CASA did as part of their campaign to reform the Bronx Housing Court was to identify the problems tenants were facing in their communities, their underlying causes, and potential solutions. CASA used the Problem Tree Exercise from **Tools for Radical Democracy: How to Organize for Power in Your Community** by Joan Minieri and Paul Gestos in order to have their members come together and decide how best to solve problems in housing court. This tool helps distinguish **problems** from **issues** and can inform which issues your organization/coalition will address in its campaign. Below, you’ll see the facilitation guide from **Tools for Radical Democracy**, adapted for this toolkit._

**Materials** 

* Butcher/chart paper with tree drawn on with branches, trunk and roots
* Markers 
* Post-it notes in three different colors

**Roles** 

* Facilitator 
* Timekeeper 

**Room Setup:** Chairs in a circle, butcher paper with tree posted on a large wall space.

**Part I: What are the problems we are facing? (Branches)**

**Facilitator:** We are going to do an exercise to determine what problems we have been facing when it comes to housing in our community. Then, we are going to brainstorm about what we can do to solve those problems. 

_Facilitator should hand out post-it notes to participants._ 

**Facilitator:** Everyone should take a Post-it note and write down a problem they are facing or have faced in housing court. One problem per Post-it note. Try to think of problems you are facing personally. Take a few minutes now to write down a problem on the post-it note. 

_Facilitator waits for participants to write down problems on a Post-it note._ 

**Facilitator:** Great. In a few minutes, we are going to share some of the problems we wrote down with the whole group, and start taping them onto the branches of the tree. 

_I’ll start with an example: [use an example that works for you_] the problem that I wrote down is that people are being harassed by their landlord, and I am going to place this onto this branch. Before we share as a group, if you are comfortable, turn to the person next to you and talk for a few minutes about the problem you wrote down. 

_Facilitator waits and give participants a few minutes to talk._ 

**Facilitator:** Ok. What are some of the problems you all identified? 

_Participants will go around and say and post the problems they wrote down on the branches. You can see some of the examples we generated on the tree itself._ 

**Part II: Issue Identification (Trunk)**

**Facilitator:** Great! Now that we’ve explored some of these problems, I want us to start thinking about some solutions. 

For example, \[use an example from your tree] one of these problems is that there aren’t enough posted signs in housing court, and they are all in English, and that makes it hard to navigate the area. Maybe a solution to that is that we can advocate for housing court to put more signs up and make them multilingual. I’m going to write “Language Access” on this new Post-it, and post it on the trunk of the tree. Let’s think of some other possible solutions and write those down. 

_Facilitator will lead group discussion on generating solutions._ 

**Part III: The Underlying Causes (Roots)**

**Facilitator:** Now that we are starting to see how problems and solutions are connected, what about what’s causing these problems we are facing? 

For example, a problem is that landlords are charging too much for rent, and harassing our poorer tenants to bring in new tenants who can pay more for rent. An underlying cause of some of these problems is capitalism-- as landlords have a vested interest in maximizing their profits. I’m going to put capitalism on this new Post-it and put it down by the branches. What are some other things that might go in the roots? 

_Facilitator leads discussion on the root causes._
